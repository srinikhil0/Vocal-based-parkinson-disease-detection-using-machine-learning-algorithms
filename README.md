# Vocal-based-parkinson-disease-detection-using-machine-learning-algorithms
The project aims to find the important features from the voice feature dataset and provide best algorithm in machine learning to detect the Parkinson’s disease, to display which algorithm provides the high accuracy of prediction for the Parkinson’s disease dataset.


Project requirements:
1) Python (Updated Version) - We write code in python.
2) Jupyter Notebook (Good for Datasciene and Machine Learning) - The ultimate editor.
3) XGBoost (pip install xgboost) - eXtreme Gradeient Boost.
4) Pandas (pip install Pandas) - To read the csv files or data sets.
5) Numpy (pip install numpy) - to operate high level mathematical functions.
6) Matplotlin (pip install matplotlib) - to visualize or plotting the data extracted by numpy.
7) sklearn (pip install sklearn) - for predictive data analysis using classsification, regression and clusstering algorithms including support vector machines (SVM).

Before starting the project i recommed to create a separate virtual environment and install the required dependencies to run effectively.

If you don't know how to create a seperate virtual environment, here is the following steps:
1) Open Anaconda command prompt.
2) conda create --name PD - Here PD is the environment name, you can give your own name
  (or) 
  you want to create environment with specific version of python then: 
conda create -n PD python=3.6 
3) Conda activate PD - Now acticate the virtual environment.
4) Now, install the dependencies mentioned above.
